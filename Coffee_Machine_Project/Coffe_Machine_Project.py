"""This code defines a menu of coffee options with their corresponding ingredients and costs, as well as a
 dictionary for the resources available to the coffee machine. It also defines several global variables for
 tracking the state of the machine, such as the amount of money deposited, whether a transaction or refund has
 been completed, and whether a question about the next transaction has been asked.

 The code includes several functions, including:

 1.print_report() which prints a report of the coffee machine's resources and the last deposit.
 2.check_resources(coffee_type) which checks if the resources are sufficient for the selected type of coffee and
 returns a boolean value.
 3.another_transaction() which prompts the user if they would like to proceed with another transaction and
 returns a boolean value.
 4. coin_process(coffee_type) which prompts the user to insert coins and verifies if the
 amount deposited is sufficient to purchase the selected type of coffee. If the amount is not sufficient,
 it gives the user the option to refund or deposit the coins.
 5. make_coffee(coffee_type) which makes the selected type of coffee if the resources are sufficient and the amount
 deposited is sufficient. The code also includes a main loop which prompts the user to select a type of coffee and
 calls the appropriate functions to process the
 transaction."""
